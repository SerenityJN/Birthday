          <h2>Happy 21st Birthday, My Loveeeeee</h2>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m so happy that this year, I get to be the one celebrating your special day with you. Itâ€™s my first time, and I hope there will be many more birthdays weâ€™ll share together. Iâ€™m so proud and thankful that youâ€™ve made it through another year youâ€™re stronger than you know, and Iâ€™m so lucky to have you.
            <br><br>
            I'm sorry if I can't be there today, please know that I'm always thinking of you every single moment. I miss you so much and I love you more than words can say. I promise Iâ€™ll make it up to you. Iâ€™ll see you on the 25th, and Iâ€™ll bring all the hugs, kisses, and love Iâ€™ve been saving just for you.
            <br><br>
            I just want to say thank you for being you. For letting me love you, for loving me with everything you have, and for choosing me even when I annoy you sometimes. Youâ€™ve always been my home, my comfort, my safe place, and my biggest blessing. I hope I make you feel the same.
            <br><br>
            As for your gift, I was thinking of bringing you an alarm clock on the 25th, para may magamit ikaw ðŸ˜† HAHAHAHAHA just kidding lang bebe.
            <br><br>
            On this special day, I just want you to know how deeply grateful I am to have you in my life. I wish you nothing but peace in your heart, true happiness, and the freedom to choose your own path to follow your dreams and become everything you truly want to be. I hope this 21st year is the one where all of that finally comes true.
            <br><br>
            I also wish that you will stop running from the things you don't want to talk about because you donâ€™t have to run anymore and you donâ€™t need to face everything alone. You have someone here you can come to whenever something happens, someone who will stay beside you through your lowest moments, hold your hand, and keep you company through it all.
            <br><br>
            You deserve to feel safe, to be seen, and to be loved for who you are. I might not have all the right words, but Iâ€™ll always be here by your side.
            <br><br>
            I love you more than words can say and I canâ€™t wait to hold you again.
            <br><br>
            Happy birthday, Nica. ðŸ’—
